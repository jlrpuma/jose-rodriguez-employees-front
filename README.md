# EmployeesFront

## Usage

1) Drag and drop a csv file with the right structure (employeeId, projectId, dateFrom, dateTo)
2) Source data will be displayed on table 
3) Click on **process data** to get the pair of workers that have some time overlapped on projects together


## Constraints

- Provide the file without headers, just with the information
- This implementation will work only if a file with the proper structure is provided, validations over the amount of information on every
row would be an improvement.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
