# EmployeesFront

## Usage

1) Drag and drop a csv file with the right structure (employeeId, projectId, dateFrom, dateTo)
2) Source data will be displayed on table 
3) Click on process data to get the pair of workers that have some time overlapped on projects together

## Constraints

This implementation will work only if a file with the proper structure is provided, validations over the amount of information on every
row would be an improvement.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
